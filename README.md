# Tabletop Exercise

The tabletop exercise aplication is make for smart arff to test of the integration and capability of emergency response resources without the expense and disruption of services incurred by a full-scale exercise. The exercise may be held as a co-ordination exercise prior to the full-scale exercise, or it may be held at intervening times in order to reconfirm procedures, policy, telephone numbers, radio frequencies, and changes in key personnel. The tabletop exercise is the simplest type of drill to stage, requiring only a meeting room, a large scale map of the airport, and a senior representative of each participating unit in attendance. A probable accident location is selected on the map and each participant describes what actions their unit would take to respond. This exercise will quickly reveal operational problems, such as conflicting communications frequencies, lack of equipment, confusing terminology and areas of jurisdiction. These exercises should be held semiannually, but not coincidental with other exercises.

This app wins first place in the competition when another participant is using an expensive app like simulator ðŸ˜‚
